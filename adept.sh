# Bash script to automate adaptive JPEG compression using common CLI tools
#
# Usage: bash adept.sh /path/to/image.jpg
#
###############################################################################
# 
# Brief overview of the script's mode of operation:
#
# The input JPG gets sliced into tiles, sized as a multiple of 8 due to the
# nature of the JPG algorithm. The tiles are run through an all-directional
# Sobel Edge Detect algorithm. The resulting tiles get further reduced to
# 2-color black+white PNGs with limited palette. 
#
# These PNGs are ideal to analyse the gray channel mean value and use it 
# as a single integer indicator to judge the perceivable complexity of 
# the current image segment.
#
# Tiles with low complexity contents get compressed stronger than others.
# At reassemlby, this leads to savings in image bytesize while maintaining
# good visual quality because no compression artefacts occur in areas of
# high-complexity or sharp contrasts. 
#

# JPEG quality setting for areas of the image deemed suitable for high compression
# Default: 66
